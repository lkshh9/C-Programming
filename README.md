# C

## Overview
The repository is a collection of open-source implementation of a variety of programs and algorithms implemented in C. basic programs and competitive programming codes both are welcomed to contribute here.  

## Features

* The repository provides implementations of various algorithms in one of the most fundamental general purpose languages - [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)).
* Well documented source code with detailed explanations provide a valuable resource for educators and students alike.
* Each source code is atomic using standard C library [`libc`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library) and _no external libraries_ are required for their compilation and execution. Thus the fundamentals of the algorithms can be studied in much depth.
* Source codes are [compiled and tested](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/C/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Awesome+CI+Workflow%22) for every commit on the latest versions of three major operating systems viz., Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu (Linux) using MSVC 16 2019, AppleClang 11.0 and GNU 7.5.0 respectively. 
* Strict adherence to [C11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)) standard ensures portability of code to embedded systems as well like ESP32, ARM Cortex, etc. with little to no changes.
* Self-checks within programs ensure correct implementations with confidence.
* Modular implementations and OpenSource licensing enable the functions to be utilized conveniently in other applications.

## contribution
This repository is opened for your contribution. let's build it a large collection of c programmatic and algorithmic codes. More to more contributions make it accessible to others and make you a better programmer. So let's do it. 

This repo helps you to access all the major programms you would required to learn the basics of C.
